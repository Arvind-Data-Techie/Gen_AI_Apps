# Gen AI Apps

Welcome to the Gen AI Apps repository! ðŸš€

### What is Gen AI Apps?

Gen AI Apps is a collection of apps developed using the power of Generative AI technologies from OpenAI and HuggingFace. We believe in the magic of AI to create all sorts of wacky, wonderful, and sometimes downright weird applications.

### Why "Gen" AI?

Well, we wanted to make sure people knew these apps are *gen*ius! But also, it's short for "Generative AI," which is the heart and soul of what we do here.

### What's Inside?

Prepare yourself for a rollercoaster ride through the minds of AI! Inside this repository, you'll find a smorgasbord of apps that can do everything from generating poetry to predicting your future based on your favorite pizza toppings. Yes, you read that right.
